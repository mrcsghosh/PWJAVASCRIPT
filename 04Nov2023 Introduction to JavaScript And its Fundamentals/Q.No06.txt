Solution:- Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for writing maintainable, readable, and self-documenting code. Clear identifiers enhance code readability and comprehension for both the original developer and others who may work with or maintain the code. 

Here are some reasons why meaningful variable names are important:

Readability:- Descriptive variable names make it easier to understand the purpose and intent of a variable. This is especially important when revisiting code after some time or when collaborating with others.

Maintenance:- Code is read more often than it is written. When you or others need to make updates or modifications to existing code, clear variable names reduce the cognitive load and make it easier to identify the role of each variable.

Debugging:- Meaningful variable names can help in debugging by providing context and reducing the time it takes to identify the source of an issue.

Collaboration:- When working on a project with a team, using clear and descriptive variable names fosters collaboration by making the codebase more accessible and understandable to all team members.

Here's an example illustrating the importance of meaningful variable names:

// Non-descriptive variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;

// Descriptive variable names
let width = 10;
let height = 5;
let area = width + height;

In the example first set of variables, 'x', 'y', and 'z' don't provide any information about their purpose. Reading the code, it's unclear what these variables represent or what operation is being performed.

In the example second set, meaningful variable names ('width', 'height', and 'area') immediately convey the purpose of each variable. It's clear that area is the result of adding 'width' and 'height'. This makes the code more readable and reduces the need for additional comments to explain the logic.
