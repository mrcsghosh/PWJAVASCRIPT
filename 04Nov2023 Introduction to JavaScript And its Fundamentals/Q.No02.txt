Solution:-

HTML:- 
Structure and Content: HTML is used to structure the content of a webpage. It defines the basic elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

Semantic Markup: HTML provides semantic elements that convey the meaning of the content, making it accessible to both browsers and developers.

Linking: HTML is used to create hyperlinks that connect different pages or resources on the web.

JavaScript:-
Interactivity: JavaScript is crucial for adding interactivity to a webpage. It allows developers to respond to user actions, such as clicks, input, and form submissions.

Dynamic Content: JavaScript enables the modification of the DOM, allowing developers to update content dynamically without requiring a page reload.

Asynchronous Operations: JavaScript is commonly used for making asynchronous requests to servers (AJAX) to fetch or send data without refreshing the entire page.

Form Validation: JavaScript can be used to validate form inputs on the client side before submitting data to the server.
